# Smart Agri App

This repository contains a Flask server and web application designed for agriculture-related functionalities, such as image-based predictions, leveraging Python, ESP32 hardware, and HTML for UI.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Uses ResNet for analyzing agricultural images.
- **Web Interface**: Flask serves as the backend for routing, with templates and static files for the frontend.
- **Hardware Integration**: Code for ESP32 setup included, enabling remote hardware interaction.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/R3tr0gh057/Agri-project`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the server: `python server.py`

## Usage

- Access the web interface at `localhost:80` after starting the server.
- Image predictions are sent in base64 format.
- You can test the prediction algorithm by running `python image.py`

## Directory Structure

- **/static**: Contains CSS and JavaScript files.
- **/templates**: HTML templates for the web interface.
- **/hardware**: ESP32 hardware configuration.

## Endpoints

- **/predict**: accepts POST requests, returns the prediction class of the plant.
